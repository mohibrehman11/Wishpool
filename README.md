**Privacy Policy**

Your privacy is important to us. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information across our suite of apps. Please read this policy carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it. We reserve the right to change our privacy policy anytime.

**1. Introduction**

This privacy policy applies to the mobile applications (the "Apps") provided by the developer ("we," "us," or "our"). We are committed to ensuring your privacy while using our Apps. Please note, we do not collect any data on behalf of third-party platforms such as Apple Inc., Google Play, or other app stores.

If you are under the age of 16, you must obtain consent from a parent or guardian before providing us with any personal information.

**2. Information We Collect**

We may collect, store, and use the following types of personal information:

- **Device and Usage Information**: This includes data about your device and interactions with the Apps, such as session durations, app launches, updates, in-app purchases, operating system, device model, geographic location, referral source, and usage patterns.
- **User-Provided Information**: Information you provide to us when you register, subscribe, sign up for email notifications, enter competitions, or interact with us in any other way.
- **Other Information**: Any additional information you choose to send us, whether through forms, feedback, or in-app communication.

**3. How We Use Your Personal Information**

We use the personal information we collect for the following purposes:

- To send you email notifications or other communications you’ve requested.
- To provide newsletters or marketing materials that we believe may be of interest to you (you can opt-out at any time).
- To send you prizes if you win a contest.
- To respond to your inquiries, feedback, and support requests.
- To improve the functionality and user experience of our Apps.
- To share aggregated, non-identifiable data with third parties for analytical purposes.
- To invite you to review our Apps or leave feedback on third-party platforms (e.g., App Store, Trustpilot).

**4. Auto-Renewable Subscription Terms**

Some of our Apps may offer subscriptions with automatic renewals. If a free trial is available, it is provided at our discretion and can be revoked at any time. Subscription plans will automatically renew as a paid service unless you disable auto-renewal at least 24 hours before the trial period ends.

Payments for subscriptions will be processed through your app store account (e.g., iTunes, Google Play). If you make a purchase before your trial ends, you will forfeit any remaining portion of the free trial.

You can manage your subscription settings, including cancellations and auto-renewals, directly through your app store account settings.

If a payment fails, access to certain features may be suspended. You may resume your subscription at any time.

**5. Disclosures**

We may share your personal information with our employees, agents, contractors, or service providers to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy. Additionally, we may disclose your information:

- If required by law.
- In connection with any legal proceedings or potential legal actions.
- To protect our legal rights and interests, including fraud prevention and credit risk reduction.
- In the event of a business transfer or sale.
- To comply with court orders or other legal obligations, if necessary.

We do not sell or share your personal data with third parties for marketing purposes without your explicit consent.

**6. International Data Transfers**

Your personal data may be stored and processed in various countries, including those outside your home country. Some countries may have data protection laws that differ from those in your country. By using our Apps, you consent to these international transfers.

**7. Security of Your Data**

We take reasonable steps to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access. We use secure servers, encryption methods (SSL), and other industry-standard security measures to protect your data.

**8. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this privacy policy periodically. When changes are made, they will be posted here with an updated date. In some cases, we may notify you via email or within the Apps. It’s important to review the privacy policy regularly to stay informed of any updates.

**9. Your Rights**

You have the right to request access to the personal information we hold about you, subject to providing proof of your identity. You may also request corrections to your personal information or ask us to stop processing it for marketing purposes by contacting us or and can leave using our apps / products.
